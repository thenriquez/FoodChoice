# Food With Friends

##This is live via https://getfoodwithfriends.herokuapp.com/

##A MEAN stack project dedicated to making bringing friends together easier.

Even with the connected world we live in it seems to be hard to bring people together.
Even a simple outing with friends can end up with many people not making decisions
or the information being lost in a mass chat never to be found again.
We hope to solve this issue, starting with food.

##Our Solution

Our application will allow a registered user to create an event/get-together.
The event owner will specify a location, date/time, optional food type, and a list of contact numbers from the friends they wish to invite.
Leveraging Yelp's Api we find what the best places are in that area and send out a url as the invites.
This form will contain a "yes", "no", or "allergies" for each place we have chosen.
Once all recipients have answered the form, or the alloted time to answer has expired,
everyone in the group will receive a message on where and when the event is taking place.
